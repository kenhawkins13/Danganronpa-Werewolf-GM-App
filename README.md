# Danganronpa-Werewolf-GM-App

This app replaces the Monokuma (Gamemaster) role in the Danganronpa 1·2 Ultimate High School Werewolf (ダンガンロンパ１·２ 超高校級の人狼) card game. So now, all the players can participate in the fun killing game. The cards from the original game are still required to play this game and they can be found here: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193245/translated-cards-print-play

We hope this app allows you to share the Danganronpa experience with your friends. Enjoy!
